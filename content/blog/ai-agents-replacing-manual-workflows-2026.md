faqSchema:
  - question: "How do AI agents automate repetitive work?"
    answer: "AI agents understand your goal in plain language, connect to your apps with a few clicks, and run workflows automatically—no code or API keys required. You describe what you want; the agent builds and runs it."
  - question: "How long does it take to set up an automation?"
    answer: "Most workflows take under 10 minutes. Pick one task, tell Flowdrop what you want, connect your tools when prompted, run a test, then turn it on. You can add more automations later."
  - question: "What should I automate first?"
    answer: "Start with one time-consuming task—e.g. moving data from emails to a spreadsheet, posting Slack updates when a form is filled, or extracting amounts from invoices. Avoid automating everything at once."

# Complete Guide: AI Agents Are Replacing Manual Workflows in 2026

How AI agents automate repetitive work is changing how teams work. Here's your step-by-step guide.

## What You'll Learn

By the end, you'll know:
- How AI agents automate repetitive work
- Why this matters for your team
- How to set it up in under 10 minutes

## What You Need

- Flowdrop account (free works fine)
- 10 minutes
- The apps you want to connect

## Step 1: Start With a Simple Goal

Don't try to automate everything at once. Pick one task that's eating your time.

Examples:
- "Move data from emails to spreadsheet"
- "Post Slack updates when form is filled"
- "Read invoices and pull out amounts"

## Step 2: Tell Flowdrop What You Want

Open Flowdrop and chat like you're texting a coworker.

Just say: "I want to [your goal]"

The agent asks questions to understand what you need. Answer naturally.

## Step 3: Connect Your Tools

Flowdrop handles the technical stuff. You just click "Connect" when prompted.

No API keys. No configuration files. Just click and it works.

## Step 4: Test It

Before turning it on, do a test run. Make sure it does what you expect.

If something's off, tell the agent. It'll fix it.

## Step 5: Turn On Automation

Once you're happy, flip it on. Now it runs by itself.

Check back in a week to make sure it's still working how you want.

## Common Mistakes

**Too ambitious:** Start with one workflow. Add more later.

**Too vague:** Say "move client emails to Projects folder" not "do something with emails."

**Set and forget:** Check your automations weekly. Make sure they're still doing what you need.

## What to Automate Next

Once you've got one running:
- Invoice processing
- Team notifications  
- File organization
- Report generation
- Data syncing between tools

## Real Example

One team automated their content pipeline:
1. Agent monitors trending topics
2. Generates blog drafts 3x daily
3. Emails drafts to content team
4. Runs automatically forever

Time saved: 15 hours per week.
