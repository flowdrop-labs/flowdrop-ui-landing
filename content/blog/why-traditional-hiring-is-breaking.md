faqSchema:
  - question: "Why is traditional hiring broken?"
    answer: "Traditional hiring (job posts, resumes, 4-6 interview rounds) takes 2-4 months, costs $15k+ per hire, and results in bad matches 30-40% of the time. Resumes are low-signal; interviews favor people who are good at talking about work, not necessarily doing it."
  - question: "What is replacing traditional hiring?"
    answer: "Trial projects (paid 1-2 week work samples), async work samples instead of live interviews, AI-powered matching that analyzes real work (GitHub, blogs, portfolios), and talent networks built on relationships instead of job boards."
  - question: "What should companies do differently?"
    answer: "Use work samples and trial projects instead of resumes. Pay for trial work. Build in public to attract talent. Move fast—top candidates get multiple offers. Use AI for sourcing and matching, not for auto-rejecting on keywords."
  - question: "What should job seekers do?"
    answer: "Build in public (GitHub, blog, side projects). Reach out directly to companies doing interesting work. Offer trial projects to prove value. Focus on output and results, not credentials. Build relationships before you need them."

Companies are spending $15k per hire, waiting 3 months to fill roles, and still getting it wrong 40% of the time. The system is broken.

## TL;DR

Traditional hiring (job posts, resumes, interviews) is slow, expensive, and inaccurate. New approaches like trial projects, async work samples, and AI-powered matching are replacing it.

<section-header text="The Traditional Hiring Playbook"></section-header>

For decades, hiring looked the same:

- Post a job description
- Wait for resumes
- Screen hundreds of applications
- Conduct 4-6 rounds of interviews
- Make an offer based mostly on gut feel
- Hope it works out

This process takes 2-4 months, costs $15k+ per hire, and results in bad matches 30-40% of the time.

In 2026, more companies are realizing: there has to be a better way.

## Why It's Breaking Down

**Resumes are theater:** A resume tells you what someone wants you to think they can do. Not what they can actually do. Everyone says they're a "rockstar" with "excellent communication skills."

**Interviews are performance art:** The best interviewees are not always the best employees. Some people are great at talking about work. Others are great at doing work. These are different skills.

**Job descriptions are wishlists:** "5 years experience in a technology that's existed for 3 years." "Ninja rockstar unicorn." Job posts have become parodies of themselves.

**The best candidates are not looking:** Top talent is not scrolling job boards. They're busy doing great work. Traditional hiring only reaches people who are actively job searching.

**Time-to-hire is killing companies:** Waiting 3 months to fill a critical role means 3 months of lost productivity. In fast-moving markets, that's unacceptable.

### Trial Projects

Instead of asking "can you do the work?" companies are saying "here's the work, show me."

- Paid trial projects (1-2 weeks)
- Async work samples
- Real problems, not whiteboard puzzles

**Why it works:** You see actual output. No guessing. No gut feel. Just results.

**Example:** A startup needs a designer. Instead of 5 rounds of interviews, they pay 3 candidates $2k each to design a feature. Best design wins the job. Everyone learns something. No wasted time.

### AI-Powered Matching

AI is getting scary good at predicting job fit.

- Analyze actual work samples, not resumes
- Match communication styles
- Predict culture fit based on real data
- Surface non-obvious candidates

**Why it works:** AI can process way more signal than a human recruiter. It finds patterns humans miss.

**Example:** A company uses AI to analyze GitHub contributions, Stack Overflow answers, and blog posts. They find a senior engineer who never applied because they didn't see the job post. Direct outreach. Hired in 2 weeks.

### Async-First Hiring

Remote work broke the "must be in office for interviews" model. Now hiring is going fully async.

- Record video answers instead of live interviews
- Async chat instead of phone screens
- Work samples instead of whiteboard problems
- Review on your schedule, not in real-time

**Why it works:** Respects everyone's time. No scheduling hell. Candidates show their best work, not their best improv.

**Example:** A remote company posts a project brief. Candidates submit solutions async. Top 3 get paid to build a more detailed version. Best one gets hired. Entire process happens without a single synchronous meeting.

### Talent Networks

Why post jobs publicly when you can build a private talent network?

- Curated communities of pre-vetted talent
- Warm introductions instead of cold applies
- Continuous relationship building, not transactional hiring

**Why it works:** Trust and context. When someone you trust vouches for a candidate, the signal is 10x stronger than a resume.

**Example:** A founder spends 2 years building relationships with great engineers. When they need to hire, they reach out directly. No job post. No recruiter. Just "hey, want to work on this?" Hired in 1 week.

<section-header text="What This Means for Companies"></section-header>

- **Stop relying on resumes:** They're the lowest-signal hiring tool. Use work samples, portfolios, and trial projects instead.
- **Pay for trial work:** If you want someone to prove they can do the job, pay them to do it. Spec work is disrespectful. Paid trials are investments.
- **Build in public:** The best way to attract talent is to show great work. Write about your challenges. Open source your tools. Be worth working with.
- **Move fast:** Top candidates get multiple offers. Speed wins. If your hiring process takes 3 months, you'll lose to the company that takes 2 weeks.
- **Use AI for sourcing, not screening:** AI is great at finding candidates. Terrible at rejecting them. Use it to surface hidden talent, not to auto-reject based on arbitrary criteria.

<section-header text="What This Means for Job Seekers"></section-header>

- **Build in public:** Your GitHub, blog, and side projects are your new resume. Show your work.
- **Skip the applications:** Direct outreach works better. Find companies doing interesting work and reach out directly.
- **Offer trial projects:** If a company won't pay for a trial, offer to do one anyway (if you can afford it). Proving your value beats talking about it.
- **Focus on output, not credentials:** Where you went to school matters less than what you've shipped. Show results.
- **Build relationships before you need them:** The best jobs come from your network, not job boards. Invest in relationships long before you're job searching.

<section-header text="The Future of Hiring"></section-header>

In 5 years, traditional hiring will look as outdated as sending resumes by fax.

The future is:

- Work samples over resumes
- Trial projects over interviews
- AI-powered matching over keyword screening
- Async collaboration over office presence
- Relationship-building over transactional applying

Companies that adapt fast will win the talent war. Those that cling to the old model will struggle to hire.

The shift is already happening. The only question is how fast you'll adapt.
