faqSchema:
  - question: "What are human in the loop forms in Flowdrop?"
    answer: "Human in the loop forms let your workflows pause and ask you questions. You can approve emails before they send, pick which leads to contact, or choose the best image from a batch. Automation handles the boring parts, you handle the decisions."
  - question: "How does chat to build validation work?"
    answer: "While you're chatting with Flowdrop to build your workflow, our system catches problems before you run anything. Missing data fields, broken logic, or wrong step order - we spot it and fix it while you build, not after it breaks."
  - question: "What is Apify integration in Flowdrop?"
    answer: "Apify integration gives you access to over 2,000 ready-made scrapers and tools. Want data from Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, Google Maps, or Amazon? Just connect the scraper and Flowdrop handles the rest of your workflow."
  - question: "Can I send Telegram messages from Flowdrop workflows?"
    answer: "Yes! Flowdrop v1.1 includes Telegram integration. Your workflows can send notifications, receive commands, and react to signals through Telegram. Perfect for trading alerts, price notifications, and team coordination."
  - question: "Do I need coding experience to use Flowdrop v1.1?"
    answer: "No coding required. Flowdrop is built around one idea: if you can chat it, you can build it. Just describe what you want in plain words and Flowdrop builds it for you. The new validation system makes it even easier by catching problems while you build."

## We Just Launched v1.1

Hi, I'm Webb. I run Flowdrop with my cofounder John. We make a no code automation tool that you build by chatting with it. If you can describe what you want, you can build it.

Today we shipped four features that change how workflows actually work. Let me walk through each one.

---

<section-header text="Human in the Loop Forms"></section-header>

This is the big one. Your workflows can now pause and ask you questions.

Here's why this matters. Before today, automation was all or nothing. Either you automate the whole thing and hope it works right, or you do it manually and waste time.

Now you get both. Automation handles the boring parts. You handle the decisions.

### Real Example

You're scraping articles from a website. Your workflow finds twenty articles. But you only want five specific ones.

Before, you had two choices. Take all twenty and sort through them later. Or write complex filters that might miss what you actually want.

Now? Your workflow stops. Shows you all twenty articles. You check the five you want. It grabs those and keeps going.

This works for anything. Approving emails before they send. Picking which leads to contact. Choosing the best image from a batch. Any time you need a human to make a call, your workflow just asks.

No more choosing between control and automation. You get both.

---

<section-header text="Chat to Build Validation"></section-header>

We added smart checks while you build.

You're chatting with Flowdrop. Describing your workflow. Our system now catches problems before you run anything.

Missing a data field? We tell you. Logic that won't work? We spot it. Steps in the wrong order? We fix it.

This is huge if you're new to automation. You don't need to understand how it works anymore. Just describe what you want. We make sure it actually functions.

You know that thing where you build a workflow, run it, and it breaks immediately? Then you spend an hour hunting for one tiny mistake?

We killed that. The chat catches it while you build.

---

<section-header text="Apify Integration"></section-header>

We connected to Apify's whole library. That's over 2,000 ready made scrapers and tools.

Want data from Instagram? There's a scraper. Need LinkedIn profiles? There's a scraper. YouTube comments, Google Maps reviews, Amazon products. All of it. Ready to use right now.

You don't build scrapers anymore. You just connect them. Then Flowdrop handles the rest of your workflow.

This changes what's possible. Want to monitor competitor prices? There's an actor for that. Track product reviews? There's an actor. Watch social mentions? There's an actor.

Just plug it in. Add your workflow steps around it. Done.

---

<section-header text="Telegram Integration"></section-header>

Your workflows can now send and receive Telegram messages.

This matters a lot for crypto folks. Trading signals. Price alerts. Community updates. All flowing through Telegram. Now all flowing through your workflows too.

But it's not just crypto. Customer support teams use Telegram. Remote teams coordinate on Telegram. If you're doing anything through Telegram, you can automate it now.

Send notifications. Receive commands. React to signals. All automatic.

---

<section-header text="Why We Built This"></section-header>

Most automation tools make you feel stupid. Not because you are. Because the tools don't help enough.

We kept hearing this from users. "I tried Make but couldn't figure it out." "Zapier is too complex for me." "I gave up on n8n."

These aren't dumb people. They're smart founders. Busy traders. Creative people building real businesses.

The tools failed them. Not the other way around.

So we built Flowdrop around one core idea: if you can chat it, you can build it. No visual builders. No coding. Just describe what you want in plain words.

And v1.1 takes this further. You're not just chatting to build anymore. You're chatting to validate. To fix problems before they happen. To understand what's actually possible.

The human in the loop forms? That's us admitting automation shouldn't be all or nothing. Sometimes you need control. Sometimes you need to decide things yourself. That's completely fine. And it should be easy.

The Apify integration? That's us saying you shouldn't rebuild what already exists. Use the work other people already did. Focus on your actual problem instead.

The Telegram connection? That's us meeting users where they already work. Not forcing new tools on people.

<section-header text="Real Examples You Can Build"></section-header>

Let me give you some actual workflows you can build today. In minutes.

### Social Media Monitor

Use Apify to scrape mentions of your brand. Human in the loop form shows you each mention. You decide which ones need responses. Auto drafted reply appears. You approve it. It sends. Telegram notifies you it's done.

### Lead Qualifier

Apify scrapes potential customers from somewhere. Form shows you each lead with their info. You pick which ones look good. Automated intro email goes out to your picks. Telegram alerts you when any of them respond.

### Content Distributor

You write one post. Workflow asks which platforms via form. You check the boxes. It formats correctly for each platform and posts everywhere. Sends you Telegram confirmation with links.

### Price Tracker

Apify monitors competitor pricing daily. Big changes trigger the human in the loop form. You see the exact details. You decide if you want to match their price. Your pricing sheet updates based on your choice.

See how this works? Automation handles all the boring repetitive stuff. You handle the actual decisions. Nothing breaks. Nothing sends without your approval.

<section-header text="The Real Story"></section-header>

I want to be honest about something. This launch almost didn't happen today.

We found a critical bug yesterday afternoon. In the validation system. The thing that's supposed to catch problems was actually causing problems.

John stayed up until 3am fixing it. I rewrote half our launch docs at midnight. We pushed the whole release back six hours.

Why am I telling you this? Because building software is genuinely messy. Launches are messy. If I pretended everything went smooth, I'd be lying to you.

But here's the thing. We shipped anyway. Because done beats perfect every time.

And that bug? It only affected one weird edge case. Would've been totally fine to ship and patch it later.

We didn't though. Because the validation feature is specifically about making you trust the system. Pretty hard to trust validation if the validation itself is broken.

So we fixed it first. Then we shipped.

<section-header text="What's Coming Next"></section-header>

We're not stopping with v1.1. Two big things on the roadmap:

**Model Context Protocol integration.** This will let you connect any tool without waiting for us to build each integration ourselves. Want to use some weird niche API? MCP makes it possible.

**Workflow marketplace.** Other people build workflows. You can buy and use them. They get paid. You save time. Everyone wins.

But today is about v1.1. About making automation actually work for regular people.

---

<section-header text="Try It Yourself"></section-header>

We're live on Product Hunt right now. Go check it out. Sign up. Build something. See if it clicks for you.

And if you get stuck at any point? Join our Discord. John and I are in there all the time. We'll literally help you build whatever you're trying to build.

Because that's the whole entire point of Flowdrop. If you can chat it, you can build it.

### Quick Start Checklist

✓ Go to Flowdrop and sign up  
✓ Think of one boring task you do manually every single day  
✓ Describe that task to our chat builder  
✓ Add a human in the loop form anywhere you need control  
✓ Test it out with real actual data  
✓ Let it run and start saving you real time

<section-header text="Why This Matters to Me"></section-header>

I failed to learn coding five times. Five actual real attempts over several years. Couldn't make it stick in my brain.

But I still needed automation. Still had boring tasks eating up my entire day. Still wanted to build cool things.

So John and I built the exact tool I wish had existed back then. The one that doesn't make you feel dumb or inadequate. The one that actually just works.

v1.1 makes it work even better than before.

Go build something cool. Then come tell me about it.
